I got curious about Scalable Vector Graphics in the browser and decided to create a central place to experiment. To explore the examples, clone the repository and open the index.html files in any modern browser.  

The [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) for SVG are a great place to start.
